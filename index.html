        <h2>Welcome to Keyboard Shorcuts!</h2>
        <aside>
            When I first started working with a keyboard, more than forty years ago, I was told, "KNOW HOW TO USE YOUR KEYBOARD!" 
            <br>
            <br>
            The location of the keys relative to each other, never changes.  Once you learn, you'll be able to type much faster.  While this seems obvious, unfortunately, most people still CAN'T Touch Type.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, I'll assume this does not apply to you.  Lets focus on Keyboard Shortcuts that are just game changers!
            <br>
            <br>
            Without further adieu fellow digital explorers, welcome to the realm of keyboard supremacy! Prepare to embark on a
            thrilling journey through the mesmerizing world of keyboards, where each keystroke unleashes
            unimaginable powers of efficiency, speed, and control. Today, we shall reveal the hidden virtues of
            the humble keyboard and equip you with a treasure trove of invaluable shortcuts. So sit back, relax,
            and let the key magic begin!

            <h2>QWERTY History</h2>
            designed to slow you down!
        </aside>
        <p>
            The QWERTY keyboard layout was developed in the late 19th century by Christopher Latham Sholes to address
            mechanical limitations in early typewriters. Its design aimed to reduce jamming by separating commonly used letter pairs and slowing down typing speed. The QWERTY layout became the standard for typewriters and was subsequently adopted for computer keyboards, where it remains the most commonly used layout today.
        </p>
    </section>
    

    <section class="row">
        
        <p>
            In addition to the QWERTY keyboard layout, several alternative keyboard layouts have been developed
            over the years.  These alternatives aim to improve typing efficiency and reduce hand strain. The Dvorak Simplified Keyboard,
            created by Dr. August Dvorak in the 1930s, is one of the most well-known alternatives. It places the most commonly used
            letters on the home row, reducing finger movement. Another alternative is the Colemak layout, which maintains a similar
            key placement to QWERTY but optimizes it for faster and more comfortable typing. Other alternatives include the
            Workman layout, which focuses on minimizing finger movement, and the Maltron layout, designed to reduce finger
            stretches. While these alternative layouts have their merits, QWERTY remains dominant due to its widespread adoption and
            compatibility with existing systems and muscle memory.
