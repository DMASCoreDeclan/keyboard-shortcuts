Keyboard-Shortcuts is a site for people who want to learn ways of becoming faster coders by knowing the ShortcutKeys instead of using a Mouse!  

The site URL is: https://dmascoredeclan.github.io/keyboard-shortcuts/index.html

The site has 5 pages.  Only 4 of the pages are visible from the Nav Bar.  dummy-page.html, simulates someone leaving the site after REGISTERING and clicking on an email verification link to be brought back to the site to LOGIN.

I wanted the site to be a bit whimsical and playful in terms of colors and I wanted to demonstrate my ability to make the site responsive.

What I learned from this project is that DESIGN is the key to rapid development.  Once you know what you're trying to achieve, its much easier to code the HTML and CSS.  I also learned, keep it simple.

## Keyboard-Shortcuts Features:
This site has a home page that gives a taste of they types of screenshots that are helpful.  However, it encourages you to Contribute by having a Register and a Login page.  Features that I would like to have but am currently unable to code are the ability for someone to contribute a Shortcut Tip through a form that would be displayed on the HOME page in the format of the current Home Page.

## Testing
Manual testing has enusred that the FORMs work at all viewport sizes and that HOVERing on the footer elements works when there is a seperate physical keyboard, (HOVERing does not feature with touch screens).  

## Bugs
There are no remaining bugs as far as I can identify.  Bugs that arose throughout were primarily around the use of FLEX, which took me 2 weeks to conquer.  Other bugs were incorrect relative referencing and incorrect cases sensitivity for the PNGs in the site.
